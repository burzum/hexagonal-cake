# Hexagonal Application Skeleton using CakePHP 3.6+

**This is a pure learning project and proof of concept! NOT ready for production!**

A hexagonal architecture is using ports and adapters to communicate and separate different layers of your application.

This application skeleton is trying to implement a hexagonal architecture using the goodies of the CakePHP framework.

## Goals

* **Learning something about software architecture**
* Trying to stay [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) compatible with all interfaces
* Trying to follow [php-pds](https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton)
* Trying to use a DIC (League/Container)
* Trying to use more [IoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)
* Trying to typehint almost everything
* Trying [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) but other approaches as well to serve pages

## Installation

* Clone the repository `git@github.com:burzum/hexagonal-cake.git`
* Go into the folder `cd hexagonal-cake`
* Run composer `composer install`
* Copy `config/app.default.php` to `config/app.php`
* Configure the database connection in your `app.php`
* Point your web server config for the host you are using to the `public` folder
* Done

## Documentation
